# UFOs

**PURPOSE/OVERVIEW**

The purpose of this project was to take all our data about UFO’s sightings and use JavaScript and HTML to create a webpage where our data is displayed properly, as well as being user friendly for everyone interested in these sightings. Our job was to change the webpage, so the user can filter through the data in multiple ways. We added 5 filters which consisted of Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. We had to update our HTML to incorporate these filters as well as our app.js file which tells the server what to do when a filter is implemented. 

Tools used:
-	JavaScript
-	HTML
-	CSS

**RESULTS**

When you reach the page you can see the title, a description, and a photo of the universe at the very top!

Filters before searching as you can see below the table where the Date, City, Stata, Country, Shape Duration and Comments are collected. If you look under the portion where it says “Filter Search” you can see that there are 5 filters you can use to search through the data instead of scrolling through it all. We haven’t filtered any of the data yet but you can see that within the text area that there are place holders to show what you are able to search in there.

Let’s type in the placeholders so that we can see how these filters work and how they change our table. You can use all 5 filters or just one of the filters if you are just looking for all the data on a certain date or a certain location! If we fill in all our place holders, we can see how the table changed to just having 1 result for those filters.

*Please note that you should use lowercase letters only and if you need to clear the filters out in order to search something else you can do so by clicking “UFO Sightings” on the top left of the page instead of having the delete all the data individually*

**SUMMARY**

One drawback is the fact that you cannot use capital letters within the searches. If you type in “Grants Pass” you will not show any results. You must type into the filter how it is shown within the table which should not matter, the data should show up either way!

*Recommendations*

1.	We should add a button named “Clear filters” so that the user is able to clear the filters out in a more convenient way, instead of scrolling back up to the top of the page.

2.	There needs to be a way for users to know what they can search through. A drop-down menu would be very helpful within the filter button. Say someone is using the city filter and types in “g” it should then have a dropdown that shows all the cities within the table that starts with g for the user to click on, especially if there is a lot of data on the website!
